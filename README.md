# :bomb:MinesweeperGame:boom:
"Minesweeper" is one of the most popular office games that used to come bundled with Microsoft Windows.
Even today, if you're using a computer with this operating system, you'll either find "Minesweeper" already installed or you can download it for free from the Microsoft Store.





# :scroll:Rules of the game
The objective of the game is to clear the playing field of all mines without detonating any of them. Players uncover cells on the field, avoiding mines. If a cell with a mine is opened, the game ends.
Numbers displayed on the cells indicate the number of mines adjacent to that cell. Using this information, the player must deduce the locations of the mines and flag them.
The game continues until all mines are flagged or all safe cells are uncovered.
